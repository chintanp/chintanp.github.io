<a id="finext" class="anchor" href="#finext" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>FINEXT</h2>

<p>Finite Element Analysis(FEA) is typically constrained in the domain of desktop, massive workstations, requiring installation and limiting access with licenses. FINEXT is an attempt to alleviate some of the problems of desktop based FEA solutions. It allows modelling from the browser, and then the model is solved in the cloud and result served back to you. This means, you do not have to install anything and work on your model from anywhere, ever your mobile device. Written completely in JavaScript, FINEXT, based on client-server architecture, allows for clear separation of concerns and would eventually allow switching either without affecting the other. Details of the current implementation and code explanation <a href="http://chintanp.github.io/finext/#/">here</a>. </p>

<a id="weather-station-server" class="anchor" href="#weather-station-server" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Weather Station Server</h2>

<p>The backend-server written in NodeJS interacts with the data-acquisition system and queries for weather data. The response is the parsed, stored in a local mongodb data database, uploaded to a cloud mongodb instance, uploaded to world weather aggregators like openweathermap.org and served to browser, all in real-time. On the browser, a minimal AngularJS app receives the data as it arrives and creates a table on the fly, so as the code is robust even for new sensor additions on the weather station. Details about the architecture, instrumentation and code <a href="http://chintanp.github.io/weather_station/#/">here</a>.</p>

<a id="staad-pro-v8i" class="anchor" href="#staad-pro-v8i" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>STAAD Pro V8i</h3>

<p>One of the most popular package for analysis and design of concrete and steel structures, it does'nt, natively play well with other applications like AUTOCAD, or EXCEL which are essentially the part of the process workflow. Thankfully, it exposes most of the functionality through it API - OpenSTAAD. Macros can be written in VBA inside STAAD that be used to control it, a few examples, introduction to the API and code explanation <a href="http://chintanp.github.io/staad_macros/">here</a>. </p>

<p>If however, you need to do something, not supported by the API currently like, for example, reading the design results, then one might have to resort more arcane approach of parsing the results file, a tedious and error-prone task, as output standards are never documented, and one has to rely on reading and understanding the results text file. Files with extension ANL generated by STAAD can be opened in a text-editor and hence, be parsed by any program. One such attempt using regular expressions to read through the file and extracting useful model information in VC++ in this <a href="https://github.com/chintanp/STAAD_VCPP2015">repo</a>.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a id="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
